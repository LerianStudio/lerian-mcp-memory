## 🎯 Key Architecture Patterns

**MCP Protocol**: JSON-RPC based memory operations with tool consolidation
**Multi-Protocol Support**: stdio, HTTP, WebSocket, SSE transport layers
**Vector Storage**: OpenAI embeddings with Qdrant vector database
**Intelligence Layer**: Pattern recognition and learning across conversations
**Multi-Tenant**: Repository-scoped isolation with access control
**Reliability**: Circuit breakers, retries, and graceful degradation

## 🔍 How to Read the Diagrams

- **Participants**: System components (MCP Server, Vector Store, AI Services, Clients)
- **Messages**: MCP tools, API calls, database operations, embeddings
- **Activations**: Processing time on each component
- **Notes**: Important business logic, error conditions, or technical details
- **Alt/Opt**: Alternative flows and optional operations

## 🛠️ System Components

### Core Services
- **MCP Server**: Main protocol handler with 9 consolidated tools
- **Vector Store**: Qdrant-based similarity search with reliability wrappers
- **AI Services**: OpenAI embeddings with circuit breakers
- **Intelligence Engine**: Pattern recognition and learning across sessions
- **Security Manager**: Multi-tenant access control and authentication

### Transport Layers
- **stdio**: Direct MCP protocol for IDE integration
- **HTTP**: JSON-RPC over HTTP with CORS support
- **WebSocket**: Real-time bidirectional communication with hub
- **SSE**: Server-sent events with heartbeat monitoring

## 📝 Updating Guidelines

When system architecture changes:
1. Update relevant sequence diagrams to reflect new flows
2. Verify participant names match current service implementations
3. Add new interaction patterns for enhanced features
4. Remove deprecated flows and outdated components
5. Update this index with new diagram references
6. Ensure diagrams reflect current tool consolidation (9 vs 41 tools)

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The MCP Memory Server implements a sophisticated memory system with:
- **41 MCP tools** (legacy) or **9 consolidated tools** (current)
- **Multi-protocol transport** for broad client compatibility
- **Vector similarity search** with OpenAI embeddings
- **AI-powered intelligence** for pattern recognition
- **Multi-tenant isolation** for secure data separation
- **Comprehensive reliability** with retries and circuit breakers
