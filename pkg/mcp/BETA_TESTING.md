# Duration: 10 minutes
```

**Benchmarks:**
- Latency p50: < 1ms
- Latency p99: < 10ms
- Error rate: < 0.01%
- Memory growth: < 100MB

#### Scenario B: Concurrent Connections
```bash
# Test: 1,000 concurrent clients
# Tool: Database query tool
# Duration: 30 minutes
```

**Benchmarks:**
- Connection handling: < 100ms
- Memory per connection: < 1MB
- CPU usage: < 80%
- No deadlocks or race conditions

#### Scenario C: Large Payloads
```bash
# Test: 10MB request/response payloads
# Tool: Data processing tool
# Operations: 100 requests
```

**Benchmarks:**
- Throughput: > 100MB/s
- Memory efficiency: < 3x payload size
- No timeouts or failures

### 4. Integration Testing (Week 4)

#### Scenario A: Claude Desktop Integration
- Install MCP-Go based tool in Claude Desktop
- Test all tool functionalities
- Verify proper lifecycle management

**Success Criteria:**
- Seamless installation
- All features work as expected
- Proper startup/shutdown

#### Scenario B: Custom Client Integration
- Build custom client using MCP-Go
- Connect to existing MCP servers
- Test bidirectional communication

**Success Criteria:**
- Compatible with reference servers
- Proper protocol compliance
- Error handling works correctly
