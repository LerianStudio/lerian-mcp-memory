## Description

2. **Goals**: List specific, measurable objectives 3. **User Stories**: Detail user narratives with benefits 4. **User Experience**: Describe personas, user flows, UI/UX considerations 5. **Functional Requirements**: Numbered list of specific functionalities 6. **Non-Goals (Out of Scope)**: What this feature will NOT include 7. **Design Considerations**: UI/UX requirements and components 8. **Technical Considerations**: Known constraints, dependencies, suggestions 9. **Success Metrics**: Measurable success criteria 10. **Data Modeling**: Core entities, relationships, key attributes, validation rules 11. **API Modeling**: Key endpoints, HTTP methods, request/response structures 12. **Sequence Diagrams**: User Interaction Flow, System Internal Flow, Full API Workflow 13. **Development Roadmap**: Logical phases with scope definition (max 5 phases) 14. **Logical Dependency Chain**: Foundation-first approach, quick wins, atomic features 15. **Risks and Mitigations**: Technical, product, and resource risks with strategies 16. **Architecture Patterns & Principles**: Hexagonal Architecture, lib-commons integration, SOLID principles 17. **Open Questions**: Remaining questions for clarification TARGET AUDIENCE: Junior developers - be explicit, unambiguous, avoid jargon. MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS: - Use Hexagonal Architecture principles (domain/adapters/infrastructure structure) - Include lib-commons integration requirements - Define entity relationships using simple language ("User has many Workflows") - Provide realistic JSON examples for API endpoints - Include mermaid sequence diagrams - Focus on atomic, testable deliverables in each phase - Include specific validation rules and error handling Generate a complete, production-ready PRD that a junior developer can use to implement the feature.
