## Feature Deep Dives

### Semantic Search Tutorial
```markdown
# Finding Anything in Seconds with MCP Memory

Let me show you the power of semantic search:

## Traditional Search vs. Semantic Search

❌ Traditional: "auth error"
✅ Semantic: "problems with user login"

## Real Example:

I asked: "how did we handle rate limiting?"

MCP Memory found:
- Conversation about API throttling
- Discussion on request quotas  
- Nginx rate limit configuration
- Redis-based rate limiter implementation

None of these contained "rate limiting" - but MCP Memory understood the concept!

Try it yourself:
1. Store a few conversations
2. Search using natural language
3. Be amazed 🤯
```

### Pattern Recognition Tutorial
```
🎯 Tutorial: Let MCP Memory Find Your Hidden Patterns

Just discovered MCP Memory identified I always forget to update API docs!

How to use pattern recognition:

1. Work normally for a week
2. Run: "Get patterns for my-repo"
3. See insights like:
   - "Modified auth.js 8 times"
   - "Error 'undefined user' occurs after deployments"
   - "TODO comments increase on Fridays"

It's like having a data scientist analyzing your workflow!

### Integration Tutorial - VS Code
```markdown
# VS Code + MCP Memory: The Perfect Match

Transform VS Code into an AI powerhouse with memory! Here's how:

## 1. Install Continue Extension
[screenshot]

## 2. Add MCP Memory to config
```json
{
  "models": [{
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-3",
    "mcpServers": {
      "memory": {
        "command": "/path/to/mcp-memory",
        "args": ["serve", "--stdio"]
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

## 3. Start Coding with Context!

Now when you ask questions, Claude remembers:
- Past debugging sessions
- Project architecture discussions
- Code review feedback
- Performance optimizations

## Workflow Tutorials

### Debugging Workflow
```
🐛 Debugging with MCP Memory: A Game Changer

Old way:
1. Hit error
2. Google frantically
3. Try random solutions
4. Forget what worked

New way:
1. Hit error
2. Ask: "Find similar errors"
3. MCP Memory shows past fixes
4. Apply what worked before

Real example from today:
[screenshot of similar error detection]

Time saved: 45 minutes → 5 minutes
```

### Code Review Workflow
```markdown
# Automated Code Review Memory

Set up MCP Memory to remember all code review feedback:

## During Review:
```
"Store code review: Always validate input in API endpoints, 
use consistent error formats, add request ID to logs"
```

## Later, while coding:
```
"What are our API coding standards?"
```

## MCP Memory returns:
- Input validation requirements
- Error format examples
- Logging standards
- Links to past reviews

Never repeat the same feedback twice!
```

### Team Knowledge Sharing
```
👥 Team Knowledge Sharing with MCP Memory

Here's how we share context across our team:

1️⃣ Each dev stores important decisions:
"Store: We chose PostgreSQL for strong consistency requirements"

2️⃣ New team member joins:
"Get project context for backend-api"

3️⃣ They instantly know:
- Tech stack decisions
- Common patterns
- Past issues & solutions
- Architecture rationale

Onboarding time: 2 weeks → 2 days! 🚀
```

## Advanced Tutorials

### Building Custom Tools
```python
# Tutorial: Build a Custom MCP Memory Tool

Want to add specialized memory features? Here's a simple example:

## 1. Create your tool function:

```python
def store_code_review(content, pr_number, repository):
    return memory.store_chunk(
        content=content,
        tags=["code-review", f"pr-{pr_number}"],
        repository=repository,
        metadata={"pr": pr_number}
    )
```

## 2. Register with MCP:

```python
@mcp_server.tool()
def code_review_memory(pr_number: int, feedback: str):
    """Store code review feedback with PR association"""
    return store_code_review(feedback, pr_number, get_current_repo())
```

## 3. Use in your AI assistant:

"Store code review for PR #123: Need better error handling"

### Performance Optimization
```
⚡ Make MCP Memory Lightning Fast

Getting slow searches? Here's how to optimize:

## 1. Index Optimization
```yaml
storage:
  chroma:
    index_params:
      metric: cosine
      ef_construction: 200
      m: 16
```

## 2. Embedding Cache
```yaml
embeddings:
  cache:
    enabled: true
    size: 10000
    ttl: 3600
```

## 3. Query Optimization
- Use specific searches
- Set appropriate limits
- Filter by date when possible

Results: 200ms → 50ms average query time!

## Troubleshooting Tutorials

### Common Issues
```
🔧 MCP Memory Troubleshooting Guide

Issue 1: "No results found"
✅ Solution: Check if conversations were stored
✅ Run: memory_health
✅ Verify ChromaDB is running

Issue 2: "Slow searches"  
✅ Restart ChromaDB
✅ Clear embedding cache
✅ Reduce search limit

Issue 3: "Connection refused"

## Interactive Demos

### CodePen/JSFiddle Demo
```javascript
// Interactive MCP Memory Search Demo

const searchMemory = async (query) => {
  // Simulated MCP Memory search
  const results = await mcpMemory.search({
    query: query,
    limit: 5
  });
  
  displayResults(results);
};

// Try these searches:
// - "authentication errors"
// - "database optimization"
// - "api rate limiting"

document.getElementById('search-btn').onclick = () => {
  const query = document.getElementById('query').value;
  searchMemory(query);
};
```

### CLI Demo GIF Scripts
```bash
# Record these interactions for GIFs:

# 1. Basic storage and retrieval
$ mcp-memory store "Implemented JWT auth with 1hr expiry"
✓ Stored successfully

$ mcp-memory search "authentication implementation"
Found 3 relevant memories:
1. "Implemented JWT auth with 1hr expiry" (95% match)
2. "Added OAuth2 for Google login" (82% match)
3. "Fixed auth token refresh bug" (78% match)

# 2. Pattern recognition
$ mcp-memory patterns --repo my-app
Identified patterns:
- Auth changes always happen on Mondays (80% correlation)
- Performance issues spike after deployments (6 occurrences)
- TODO comments increase before deadlines (lol)
