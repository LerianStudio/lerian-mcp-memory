# ST-008-03: Database Migration System and Schema Versioning

**Parent Task**: MT-008 - Database Schema Implementation and Production Infrastructure  
**Duration**: 3 hours  
**Type**: Database Operations

## Overview
Implement comprehensive database migration system with proper schema versioning, rollback capabilities, and validation.

## Scope
- Create migration system with up/down migrations
- Implement schema versioning and tracking
- Add migration validation and testing
- Create rollback capabilities for safe deployments
- Setup migration dry-run functionality
- Implement migration dependency management
- Add migration status monitoring

## Technical Requirements
- Migration files with SQL up/down scripts
- Migration tracking table with version history
- Migration validation before execution
- Rollback scripts for each migration
- Dry-run mode for testing migrations
- Migration dependency resolution
- Error handling and recovery

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Migration system applies changes incrementally
- [ ] Schema versioning tracks all changes accurately
- [ ] Rollback functionality works for safe deployments
- [ ] Migration validation prevents destructive changes
- [ ] Dry-run mode allows testing without changes
- [ ] Migration dependencies are resolved correctly
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback
- [ ] Migration status is visible and monitorable

## Files to Create/Modify
- `cmd/migrate/main.go` - Migration command line tool
- `internal/migration/migrator.go` - Migration engine
- `internal/migration/validator.go` - Migration validation
- `internal/migration/tracker.go` - Version tracking
- `migrations/000_create_migration_table.sql` - Migration tracking table
- `scripts/migrate.sh` - Migration deployment script

## Dependencies
- Database connection management
- SQL parsing and validation tools
- Migration tracking infrastructure

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for migration logic
- Integration tests for migration execution
- Rollback scenario testing
- Migration dependency testing
- Error handling validation

## Success Metrics
- Migration success rate 100%
- Rollback reliability 100%
- Validation accuracy >99%
- Dependency resolution 100%
