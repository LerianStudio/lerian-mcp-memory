# ST-008-06: Production Docker Compose and Infrastructure

**Parent Task**: MT-008 - Database Schema Implementation and Production Infrastructure  
**Duration**: 3 hours  
**Type**: Production Infrastructure

## Overview
Implement production-ready Docker Compose configuration with proper networking, volumes, monitoring, and deployment procedures.

## Scope
- Create production Docker Compose configuration
- Setup proper networking and security
- Implement volume management and persistence
- Add health checks and monitoring
- Create backup and recovery procedures
- Setup environment configuration management
- Implement deployment automation

## Technical Requirements
- Production Docker Compose with all services
- Secure networking with proper isolation
- Persistent volumes for data storage
- Health checks for all services
- Monitoring integration (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Automated backup procedures
- Environment-specific configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Production Docker Compose deploys successfully
- [ ] All services start and remain healthy
- [ ] Data persistence works across container restarts
- [ ] Health checks detect and report service issues
- [ ] Monitoring provides comprehensive system visibility
- [ ] Backup procedures protect against data loss
- [ ] Environment configuration supports multiple deployments
- [ ] Deployment automation reduces manual intervention

## Files to Create/Modify
- `docker-compose.production.yml` - Production compose configuration
- `docker-compose.monitoring.yml` - Monitoring stack
- `configs/production/` - Production configuration files
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - Deployment automation
- `scripts/backup.sh` - Backup procedures
- `scripts/health_check.sh` - Health check scripts

## Dependencies
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Production infrastructure environment
- Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Backup storage solution

## Testing Requirements
- Deployment testing in production-like environment
- Service health check validation
- Data persistence testing
- Backup and recovery testing
- Monitoring integration testing

## Success Metrics
- Deployment success rate 100%
- Service uptime >99.9%
- Backup reliability 100%
- Health check accuracy >99%
