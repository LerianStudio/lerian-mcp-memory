# ST-008-04: Database Performance Optimization and Indexing

**Parent Task**: MT-008 - Database Schema Implementation and Production Infrastructure  
**Duration**: 4 hours  
**Type**: Performance Optimization

## Overview
Implement comprehensive database performance optimization including strategic indexing, query optimization, and connection pooling.

## Scope
- Create strategic indexing for all common query patterns
- Implement database connection pooling
- Add query performance monitoring
- Create database query optimization
- Setup database statistics and maintenance
- Implement query caching where appropriate
- Add database performance metrics

## Technical Requirements
- Composite indexes for multi-column queries
- Connection pool with configurable limits
- Query performance monitoring with slow query logging
- Query plan analysis and optimization
- Database maintenance tasks (VACUUM, ANALYZE)
- Query result caching for frequently accessed data
- Performance metrics collection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All common queries execute within performance targets
- [ ] Connection pooling handles concurrent connections efficiently
- [ ] Slow query monitoring identifies performance issues
- [ ] Database maintenance keeps performance optimal
- [ ] Query caching improves response times
- [ ] Performance metrics provide visibility into database health
- [ ] Index strategy optimizes both read and write performance
- [ ] Database can handle expected user load without degradation

## Files to Create/Modify
- `internal/storage/connection_pool.go` - Connection pooling
- `internal/storage/query_optimizer.go` - Query optimization
- `internal/storage/performance_monitor.go` - Performance monitoring
- `internal/storage/cache_manager.go` - Query caching
- `scripts/db_maintenance.sql` - Database maintenance scripts
- `configs/database.yaml` - Database configuration

## Dependencies
- PostgreSQL connection pooling library
- Query performance monitoring tools
- Caching infrastructure

## Testing Requirements
- Performance tests for all query patterns
- Load testing with connection pooling
- Index effectiveness measurement
- Cache hit ratio validation
- Database maintenance testing

## Success Metrics
- Query performance <50ms p95
- Connection pool efficiency >90%
- Cache hit ratio >70%
- Index coverage >90%
