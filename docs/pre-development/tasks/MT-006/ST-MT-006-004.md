# ST-006-04: AI-Powered Task Generation and Suggestion Engine

**Parent Task**: MT-006 - Server-Side AI Integration and HTTP API Foundation  
**Duration**: 4 hours  
**Type**: AI Processing

## Overview
Implement AI-powered task generation engine that creates relevant, actionable tasks from PRD content and provides intelligent task suggestions based on context.

## Scope
- Create task suggestion endpoint (`POST /api/v1/tasks/suggest`)
- Implement AI-powered task generation from PRDs
- Add contextual task suggestions based on project state
- Create task complexity analysis and effort estimation
- Implement task relationship detection and dependency mapping
- Add task template matching and application
- Setup task validation and quality scoring

## Technical Requirements
- Task suggestion API with context analysis
- AI prompt engineering for task generation
- Task complexity algorithms with effort estimation
- Dependency detection between generated tasks
- Task template system with intelligent matching
- Quality scoring for generated tasks
- Task validation against project requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Task suggestion endpoint provides relevant, actionable tasks
- [ ] AI-generated tasks have >80% relevance to input PRDs
- [ ] Task complexity analysis accuracy within 20% of manual estimates
- [ ] Dependency detection identifies logical task relationships
- [ ] Task templates improve generation consistency
- [ ] Quality scoring filters out poor suggestions
- [ ] Generated tasks include clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Task generation completes within 30 seconds

## Files to Create/Modify
- `internal/api/handlers/task_handler.go` - Task suggestion endpoint
- `internal/tasks/generator.go` - AI task generation engine
- `internal/tasks/suggester.go` - Contextual task suggestions
- `internal/tasks/complexity.go` - Complexity analysis
- `internal/tasks/dependencies.go` - Dependency detection
- `internal/tasks/templates.go` - Task template system
- `internal/tasks/validator.go` - Task validation
