# ST-007-03: Comprehensive Security Middleware Stack

**Parent Task**: MT-007 - Production Security and Real-Time Communication Framework  
**Duration**: 3 hours  
**Type**: Security Infrastructure

## Overview
Implement production-grade security middleware including CORS, input validation, sanitization, and security headers.

## Scope
- Create CORS middleware with configurable origins
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Add security headers middleware
- Create request/response logging for security audit
- Implement SQL injection and XSS protection
- Add content type validation
- Setup security monitoring and alerting

## Technical Requirements
- CORS configuration for development and production
- Input validation with sanitization rules
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Request sanitization for common attack vectors
- Audit logging with security events
- Content-Type validation and enforcement
- Rate limiting integration for security

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CORS middleware allows legitimate CLI requests
- [ ] Input validation blocks malicious payloads
- [ ] Security headers are properly set on all responses
- [ ] SQL injection attempts are detected and blocked
- [ ] XSS payloads are sanitized or rejected
- [ ] Security audit logs capture important events
- [ ] Content-Type validation prevents malformed requests
- [ ] Security middleware doesn't impact performance significantly

## Files to Create/Modify
- `internal/api/middleware/cors.go` - CORS configuration
- `internal/api/middleware/validation.go` - Input validation
- `internal/api/middleware/security_headers.go` - Security headers
- `internal/api/middleware/sanitization.go` - Input sanitization
- `internal/security/audit_logger.go` - Security audit logging
- `internal/security/validator.go` - Security validation rules

## Dependencies
- Input validation library
- Security scanning tools
- Audit logging infrastructure

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for each security middleware
- Security penetration testing
- Input validation boundary testing
- CORS configuration validation
- Security header verification

## Success Metrics
- Security validation accuracy >99%
- CORS policy enforcement 100%
- Audit log completeness >95%
- Performance overhead <10ms
