# ST-007-04: Event-Driven Architecture for Real-Time Updates

**Parent Task**: MT-007 - Production Security and Real-Time Communication Framework  
**Duration**: 4 hours  
**Type**: Event Architecture

## Overview
Implement event bus system for distributing real-time updates across WebSocket connections and push notifications.

## Scope
- Create event bus with pub/sub pattern
- Implement event types and serialization
- Add event filtering and routing
- Create event persistence for reliability
- Setup event replay capability
- Implement event ordering and deduplication
- Add event metrics and monitoring

## Technical Requirements
- Event bus with channel-based or message queue backend
- Event type system with versioning
- Event filtering by repository, user, or criteria
- Event persistence with configurable retention
- Event ordering guarantees for related events
- Deduplication mechanism for repeated events
- Performance optimized event distribution

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Event bus distributes updates to all connected clients
- [ ] Event filtering works correctly for repository-specific updates
- [ ] Event ordering is maintained for related changes
- [ ] Event persistence enables reliable delivery
- [ ] Event replay works for reconnecting clients
- [ ] Deduplication prevents duplicate notifications
- [ ] Event distribution latency is under 10ms
- [ ] Event metrics track performance and reliability

## Files to Create/Modify
- `internal/events/bus.go` - Event bus implementation
- `internal/events/types.go` - Event type definitions
- `internal/events/filter.go` - Event filtering logic
- `internal/events/persistence.go` - Event persistence
- `internal/events/metrics.go` - Event metrics
- `internal/events/distributor.go` - Event distribution

## Dependencies
- Message queue or channel system
- Event persistence storage
- WebSocket server (ST-007-01)
- Push notification system (ST-007-02)

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for event bus functionality
- Integration tests with WebSocket and push systems
- Event ordering and deduplication testing
- Performance testing with high event volumes
- Reliability testing with system failures

## Success Metrics
- Event distribution latency <10ms
- Event ordering accuracy 100%
- Deduplication effectiveness >99%
- Event throughput >1000 events/sec
