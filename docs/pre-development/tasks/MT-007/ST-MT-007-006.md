# ST-007-06: Connection Recovery and Monitoring Systems

**Parent Task**: MT-007 - Production Security and Real-Time Communication Framework  
**Duration**: 3 hours  
**Type**: Reliability & Monitoring

## Overview
Implement comprehensive connection recovery mechanisms and monitoring systems for production reliability.

## Scope
- Create automatic connection recovery for WebSocket clients
- Implement connection health monitoring
- Add connection quality metrics (latency, throughput)
- Create alerting for connection issues
- Setup connection debugging and diagnostics
- Implement connection failover mechanisms
- Add connection performance optimization

## Technical Requirements
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Connection health scoring and monitoring
- Latency and throughput measurement
- Alert thresholds for connection issues
- Debug logging for connection problems
- Failover to HTTP polling when WebSocket fails
- Connection pool optimization for performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic reconnection works reliably after network interruptions
- [ ] Connection health monitoring detects and reports issues
- [ ] Connection quality metrics are accurate and useful
- [ ] Alerting triggers appropriately for connection problems
- [ ] Debug information helps troubleshoot connection issues
- [ ] Failover mechanisms provide seamless user experience
- [ ] Connection recovery time is under 5 seconds
- [ ] Monitoring overhead doesn't impact performance

## Files to Create/Modify
- `internal/websocket/recovery.go` - Connection recovery logic
- `internal/websocket/health_monitor.go` - Health monitoring
- `internal/websocket/metrics_collector.go` - Connection metrics
- `internal/monitoring/connection_alerts.go` - Connection alerting
- `internal/websocket/diagnostics.go` - Connection diagnostics
- `internal/websocket/failover.go` - Failover mechanisms

## Dependencies
