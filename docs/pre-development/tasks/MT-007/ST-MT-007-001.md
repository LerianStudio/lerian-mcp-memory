# ST-007-01: WebSocket Server Implementation and Connection Management

**Parent Task**: MT-007 - Production Security and Real-Time Communication Framework  
**Duration**: 4 hours  
**Type**: Real-Time Infrastructure

## Overview
Implement a robust WebSocket server for real-time bidirectional communication between CLI and server with comprehensive connection management.

## Scope
- Create WebSocket server with upgrade handling
- Implement connection pooling and lifecycle management
- Add heartbeat monitoring and automatic reconnection
- Setup connection authentication and authorization
- Create connection state management
- Implement connection metrics and monitoring
- Add graceful connection cleanup

## Technical Requirements
- gorilla/websocket library for WebSocket implementation
- Connection pool with configurable limits
- Heartbeat/ping-pong mechanism for connection health
- Connection metadata tracking (client info, timestamps)
- Thread-safe connection management
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Connection-level rate limiting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WebSocket server accepts connections at `/api/v1/ws`
- [ ] Connection pool manages up to 1000+ concurrent connections
- [ ] Heartbeat mechanism detects and handles dead connections
- [ ] Connection authentication validates CLI versions
- [ ] Connection metadata is properly tracked
- [ ] Graceful shutdown closes all connections cleanly
- [ ] Connection metrics are collected and exposed
- [ ] Memory usage scales linearly with connection count

## Files to Create/Modify
- `internal/websocket/server.go` - WebSocket server implementation
- `internal/websocket/connection.go` - Connection management
- `internal/websocket/pool.go` - Connection pooling
- `internal/websocket/heartbeat.go` - Health monitoring
- `internal/websocket/metrics.go` - Connection metrics
- `internal/api/handlers/websocket_handler.go` - WebSocket upgrade handler

## Dependencies
- gorilla/websocket library
- Connection metrics infrastructure
- HTTP API foundation from MT-006

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for connection management logic
- Integration tests with multiple concurrent connections
- Load testing with 1000+ connections
- Network interruption testing
- Memory leak testing with connection churn

## Success Metrics
- Connection capacity >1000 concurrent
- Heartbeat detection <30s
- Memory usage linear scaling
- Graceful shutdown 100% success
