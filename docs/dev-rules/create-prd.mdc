# Rule: Generating a Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format, based on an initial user prompt. The PRD should be clear, actionable, and suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement the feature.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description or request for a new feature or functionality.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before writing the PRD, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail. The goal is to understand the "what" and "why" of the feature, not necessarily the "how" (which the developer will figure out).
3.  **Generate PRD:** Based on the initial prompt and the user's answers to the clarifying questions, generate a PRD using the structure outlined below.
4.  **Save PRD:** Save the generated document as `prd-[feature-name].md` inside the `/docs/` directory.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are some common areas to explore:

*   **Problem/Goal:** "What problem does this feature solve for the user?" or "What is the main goal we want to achieve with this feature?"
*   **Target User:** "Who is the primary user of this feature?"
*   **Core Functionality:** "Can you describe the key actions a user should be able to perform with this feature?"
*   **User Stories:** "Could you provide a few user stories? (e.g., As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [benefit].)"
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** "How will we know when this feature is successfully implemented? What are the key success criteria?"
*   **Scope/Boundaries:** "Are there any specific things this feature *should not* do (non-goals)?"
*   **Data Requirements:** "What kind of data does this feature need to display or manipulate?"
*   **Data Relationships:** "How does this feature's data relate to existing entities in the system?"
*   **API Requirements:** "What API endpoints will this feature need? Should it follow REST conventions?"
*   **User Flow:** "Can you walk me through the step-by-step user journey for this feature?"
*   **User Personas:** "Who are the different types of users for this feature? What are their characteristics and goals?"
*   **System Integration:** "How should this feature integrate with existing system components?"
*   **Development Phases:** "How would you prioritize the development? What's the minimum viable version?"
*   **Dependencies:** "What needs to be built first before this feature can work? What's the logical order?"
*   **Technical Risks:** "What technical challenges do you foresee? What could go wrong during development?"
*   **Design/UI:** "Are there any existing design mockups or UI guidelines to follow?" or "Can you describe the desired look and feel?"
*   **Edge Cases:** "Are there any potential edge cases or error conditions we should consider?"

## PRD Structure

The generated PRD should include the following sections (strictly using this numbering system):

0. **Index**: ///REVIEW
1.  **Introduction/Overview:** Briefly describe the feature and the problem it solves. State the goal.
2.  **Goals:** List the specific, measurable objectives for this feature.
3.  **User Stories:** Detail the user narratives describing feature usage and benefits.
4.  **User Experience:** Describe user personas, key user flows, and UI/UX considerations. Include target user characteristics, user journey mapping, and interaction patterns.
5.  **Functional Requirements:** List the specific functionalities the feature must have. Use clear, concise language (e.g., "The system must allow users to upload a profile picture."). Number these requirements.
6.  **Non-Goals (Out of Scope):** Clearly state what this feature will *not* include to manage scope.
7.  **Design Considerations:** Link to mockups, describe UI/UX requirements, or mention relevant components/styles if applicable.
8.  **Technical Considerations:** Mention any known technical constraints, dependencies, or suggestions (e.g., "Should integrate with the existing Auth module").
9.  **Success Metrics:** How will the success of this feature be measured? (e.g., "Increase user engagement by 10%", "Reduce support tickets related to X").
10. **Data Modeling:** Define the core data entities, their relationships, and key attributes needed for the feature. Include entity descriptions, primary relationships, and data validation rules. Use simple entity-relationship descriptions suitable for junior developers (e.g., "User has many Workflows", "Workflow belongs to User").
11. **API Modeling:** Outline the key API endpoints needed for the feature, including HTTP methods, request/response structures, and basic validation rules. Focus on the business logic and data flow rather than implementation details. Include examples of request/response payloads in JSON format.
12. **Sequence Diagrams:** Provide three types of interaction flows using mermaid syntax:
    - **User Interaction Flow:** Step-by-step user journey through the feature UI/UX
    - **System Internal Flow:** How different system components interact to fulfill the user's request
    - **Full API Workflow:** Complete request-response cycle including authentication, validation, processing, and response
13. **Development Roadmap:** Break down the development process into logical phases focusing on scope and deliverables. Define MVP requirements and future enhancements without specific timelines. Focus on what needs to be built in each phase for proper task breakdown.
14. **Logical Dependency Chain:** Define the logical order of development, identifying which features need to be built first (foundation), how to get quickly to a usable/visible frontend, and proper pacing/scoping of each feature to be atomic yet buildable.
15. **Risks and Mitigations:** Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies, including technical challenges, MVP scope definition, and resource constraints.
16. **Architecture Patterns & Principles:** Define the mandatory architectural patterns, principles, and standards that must be followed during implementation, including Hexagonal Architecture requirements, repository patterns, and lib-commons integration.
17. **Open Questions:** List any remaining questions or areas needing further clarification.

- **Atomic Features:** Each feature should be complete and testable independently
- **Build-Upon Strategy:** Features should enable and enhance subsequent features
- **Example Format:**
  ```
  **Foundation Layer:**
  1. Database schema and basic models
  2. Authentication system
  3. Core API framework
  
  **Usable Frontend Path:**
  4. Basic workflow creation UI
  5. Workflow execution trigger
  6. Status monitoring dashboard
  ```

### Risks and Mitigations Guidelines
- **Technical Risks:** Technology challenges, integration complexity, performance concerns

- **Example Format:**
  ```
  **Risk: Complex authentication integration**
  - Impact: High - Could delay MVP delivery
  - Probability: Medium
  - Mitigation: Start with simple auth, plan phased approach
  - Contingency: Use existing auth service as fallback
  ```

### Architecture Patterns & Principles Guidelines

#### Hexagonal Architecture (Mandatory)
**ALL transactional plugins MUST follow Hexagonal Architecture principles.**

**Core Components:**
```
src/
├── domain/           # Business logic (pure, no external dependencies)
│   ├── entities/     # Core business entities
│   ├── services/     # Domain services
│   └── ports/        # Interfaces for external dependencies
├── adapters/         # External integrations
│   ├── primary/      # Controllers, handlers (inbound)
│   ├── secondary/    # Database, APIs, external services (outbound)
│   └── config/       # Configuration adapters
└── infrastructure/   # Cross-cutting concerns
    ├── database/     # Database setup and migrations
    ├── observability/# Logging, metrics, tracing
    └── security/     # Authentication, authorization
```

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] **Domain Isolation**: Domain layer has no external dependencies
- [ ] **Port Interfaces**: All external dependencies defined as interfaces
- [ ] **Adapter Implementation**: Clear separation of inbound/outbound adapters
- [ ] **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI container configuration
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Easy to unit test domain logic in isolation

#### Repository Patterns
