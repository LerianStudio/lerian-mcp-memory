# MCP Memory - Intelligent Context Management for AI Development

Welcome to MCP Memory, a powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides intelligent memory and context management for AI-powered development workflows.

## 🚀 What is MCP Memory?

MCP Memory is an advanced memory server that helps AI assistants like Claude maintain context across conversations, learn from past interactions, and provide more intelligent suggestions based on your project history.

### Key Features

- **🧠 Intelligent Memory**: Stores and retrieves conversation context with semantic search
- **🔍 Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring problems and solutions across your development history
- **📊 Knowledge Graphs**: Builds understanding of your codebase relationships and architecture
- **🏗️ Multi-Repository Support**: Manages context across multiple projects seamlessly
- **🔐 Privacy-First**: All data stored locally with optional encryption
- **⚡ High Performance**: Optimized for fast retrieval and minimal latency

## Why MCP Memory?

Traditional AI assistants start fresh with each conversation, losing valuable context about your project, preferences, and past decisions. MCP Memory solves this by:

1. **Preserving Context**: Remember architectural decisions, coding patterns, and project-specific knowledge
2. **Learning from History**: Identify what worked (and what didn't) in similar situations
3. **Accelerating Development**: Reduce time explaining context and get straight to solving problems
4. **Improving Accuracy**: Make better suggestions based on your actual codebase and history
