# MCP Memory Server - Development Roadmap

This document outlines potential improvements and future development priorities for the mcp-memory project.

## 🔴 Critical Architecture Issues

### 1. ~~Fix Missing Interface Implementations~~ ✅ COMPLETED

- **Issue**: `VectorStorage` interface not implemented, causing nil initializations
- **Solution**: Complete the interface implementation for storage layer
- **Impact**: High - Core functionality broken
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved - VectorStore interface is implemented in ChromaStore

### 2. Add Dependency Injection

- **Issue**: Direct instantiation throughout codebase reduces testability
- **Solution**: Implement DI pattern or use a DI framework (e.g., Wire)
- **Impact**: Medium - Improves testing and modularity

### 3. ~~Fix Module Imports~~ ✅ RESOLVED

- **Issue**: Imports use `mcp-memory` instead of `github.com/fredcamaral/mcp-memory`
- **Solution**: Update all import paths to match go.mod
- **Impact**: High - Prevents proper building
- **Status**: ✅ Not an issue - Module name `mcp-memory` is correct for private/local development
